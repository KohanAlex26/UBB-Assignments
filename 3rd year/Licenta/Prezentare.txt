-The main goal of this thesis is to describe certain numerical integration methods, together with their properties and solutions. There will also be some Matlab code examples
as well as real-world applications of these topics. This bachelor’s thesis was motivated by
the practicality of numerical integration methods in our daily lives. It’s used to identify
irregularly shaped areas. It has a wide range of applications in physics, mathematics,
chemistry, and computer science. All the examples presented below are created by me except for the last one.

-Petronas buildings were designed using integration methods to make them stronger. Finding volumes of wine barrels was one of the early applications of integration.

-Differentiation is a method of finding the derivative of a function. Mathematicians use a procedure called differentiation to determine a function's instantaneous rate of change based on one of its variables.
Example: We use the forward difference formula for this exercise for the function 1/x and x0=2,3.
Using the optimal value for h gives us minimal error. This formula is known as the forward-difference formula if h > 0 and the backward-difference formula if h < 0.
We can also calculate a bound for the aproximation error. We can conclude that 0.02 is more suitable for h than the other two.


-We introduce the weighted mean value here because we'll utilize it later.
-We need a cotinuos function f on [a,b], a rieman integrable function g on [a,b] that does not change its sign(A bounded function on a compact interval [a, b] is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere)
Example: We have the function 1+x^2 on the interval [-1,2]. We apply the Weighted Mean Value Theorem.
The function is a continous function om that interval because we have a sum of elementary functions. We apply the definition for g(x)≡1.
The average value of the function is 2 for c = ±1.

-Simpson's rule is a method of numerical integration which is a good deal more accurate than the Trapezoidal rule. We want to compare the two methods of approximation.
Example: We use the aproximation methods for the function x^3 on the interval [1,3] without the errors, that's why we have aproximately equal and not equal.
We get 28 for the Trapezoidal aproximation and 20 for Simpson which is the exact value of the integral. Our hypothesis comes true, Simpson's being more accurate.

-Composite rules are applied on subintervals. We have n+1 numbers x0 being the first one and xn being the last one. It is like an arithmetic progresion with ratio h. That's why h=(b-a)/n, b being the last element and a the first one.
The difference between the composite trapezoidal rule and the trapezoidal rule is that in the composite one the interval [a,b] is divided into n parts, each value of each point in the interval being added to the sum. At the error of the compound rule we will subtract n terms.
Example: We have the function 5*x*e^(-2*x) and three segments should be used so n=3. So we calculate h, we give common factor 1/2 and substitute everything and we'll get 0.38. At the point b we ll do an integration by parts to get our exact value of the integral. The error is the difference between aproximation and exact value.

-For the Composite Simpson Rule and The Simpson Rule are similar as well except for the fact that at the Composite one we have n terms and each value of each term will be added to the sum with coefficient 4 if it the coefficient is an odd number and 2 if it is an even one.

-The Closed Newton Cotes chapter is more to present what kind of methods are part of the closed ones, the trapezoidal method being already presented.

-For the Open Newton Cotes with n=0 we have the Midpoint Rule. Here x_{-1} is a and x_{n+1} is b and x_{0} is the middle of the interval. h = (b-a)/(n+2) probably because we add the term x_{-1} and x_{n+1}.

-We have the adaptive Quadrature which uses Simpson's Rule multiple times. Basically we have to compare the two absolute values and we conclude that they are very similar.

-And for the last part I chose a real life application with matlab code, more precisely the calculation of an ellipsoidal surface. We have an elipsoid because we rotate the ellipse around the x axis. We have the equation of the radius, certain values for alpha and beta and an integral. Syms lists the names of all symbolic scalar variables, functions, and arrays in the MATLAB workspace. Sym is a simbolic variable.
vpa is used for the number of decimals. For the last part we have 4 numerical integration methods compared based on aproximation error. The 4*pi*alpha is common to all 4. The integral is different. Romberg has the biggest error so it's the worst in this case.
