                Sports</h1>
            <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve
                physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment
                to
                spectators. Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health.
                Hundreds
                of
                sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous
                participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many
                contestants
                may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is
                between
                two
                sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no
                single
                winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may
                be
                arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging
                games in
                a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>
